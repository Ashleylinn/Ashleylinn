I'm currently a student specializing in Information Technology and Business. This space is where I keep track of the projects, assignments, and cool things I’ve built during school! I enjoy exploring how tech can solve real-world problems, whether it's through building apps, analyzing data, or designing user-friendly systems. My interests span from coding and system design to digital marketing and business strategy. Feel free to browse around — each project here reflects a step in my learning journey!
